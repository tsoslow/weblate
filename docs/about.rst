About Weblate
=============

Project goals
-------------

Web based localization tool with tight Git integration supporting a wide range
of file formats, making it easy for translators to contribute.

The translations should be kept within the same repository as the source code and
the translation process should follow development closely.

There is no plan regarding heavy conflict resolution, as these should be
handled primarily by Git.

Project name
------------

The project is named as combination of the words "web" and "translate".
